'''
The np.dot() method treats the matrix as
a list of vectors and performs a dot product of each of those vectors with the other vector. In this
example, we used that property to pass a matrix, which was a list of neuron weight vectors and a
vector of inputs and get a list of dot products â€” neuron outputs.
